Ten year Treasury (aka 'T10') is one of the most watched metric for financial institutions.  It has been rising lately after a long period of staying very low. 

Yield rise is because prices are down.  

Prices are down because demand has droppoed, and more are selling than buying. 

Why are people (and 'people') selling bonds(T10)?  

Patrick Pancoast from Intuition Learning explains the reason.

We all know that inflation has been rising.  

People look at inflation, and they anticipate the Fed will be raising rates (and the Fed has been). 

They do not want to hold on bonds. 

> "If I hold the bonds, **when the Fed raises rates, prices of the bonds will drop**."  

> "So I should sell them.  If I want to buy T10, I will buy the newly issued bonds (at a cheaper price) later when rates are higher" 

Therefore, when there is expectation that the Fed is raising rates, bond yield will rise.
