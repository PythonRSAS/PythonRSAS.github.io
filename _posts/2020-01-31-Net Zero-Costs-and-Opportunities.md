> To reach Net zero emission goal by 2050/2060, a lot will need to be changed.  Nearly all industries will be going through changes. Trillions of dollars of investment will be required, which will provide many opportunities to businesses. 

### What is Net Zero

GHG emission has been increasing in a very fast pace since the industrial revolution.  Net Zero means the steady state that GHG in atomosphere is no longer increasing.  In other words, emission released and emission absorbed cancel out each other.  

The focus of GHG is CO2.  CO2 in atomosphere is like a blanket, keeping the Earth warm.   When CO2 increases, the tempreture increases.  Most of the energy on the Earth is absorbed by waters (oceans, lakes and rivers).  When tempretre warms up, the waters expand in volume.  Melting of the ice add more water.  

### High impact industries

> While all industries will need to adapt, some are much more impacted than others:  **Fossil fuel** (oil, gas and coal), **Power Generation**,  **Metals & Mining** and **Transportation** (including Auto and Aviation). 

 The sectors are not isolated from each other.  For example, some O&G companies are also in the business of renewable energy (wind, solar etc.), EV charging (BP and Shell both own many EV charging stations), and even metals & mining (Exxon has invested in lithium mining);  Furthermore, the dynamics within each sector can differ greatly.  

* **Oil & Gas** - Natural gas is determined as a key energy for energy transition as it has lower emission intensity than oil
* **Coal** - Metalurrical coal is regarded 
* **Power Generation** - Power Generation sector dynamics differ by region.  
* **Metals & Mining** - Exercitation irure dolore ullamco ullam voluptate esse qui.
* **Auto** - Tgkdfg lfgfgd fgkgdfl.
* **Aviation** - Exercitation eiusmod non in minim aliqua occaecat ut.

### Adapt and innovate
People are great at adapting.  The history of the O&G industry is one example.  At the beginning, karosene oil was extracted from crude oil for lights as it was much cheaper than whale fat that was used then for light.  Gasoline and other by products were dumped into the rivers.  It was only when automobile was invented that the use of gasoline as a fuel started.  Then we have petrochemical, and much much more.  Look at what we have now: consuming millions of barrels of oil a day.   We will be changing and adapting again. 

For banks, most term loans have maturity of only 3 to 5 years.  When the loans mature, the banks can decide whether to lend again or not.  Both borrowers and lenders have time to adapt and innovate.  

If a company moves too fast to renewables, the cost may outweigh the income, and this is not sustainable for investors or the company.  For example, some large O&G companies have cut back on their green energy programs.   Changing too fast is often a risk in themselves, as everything in life. 

### Climate simulation
From a high level, one may take a look at the interactive scenarios that plays out for the next 80 years.
