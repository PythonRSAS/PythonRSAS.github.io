Quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20longest,bananas%22%20is%20%22anana%22.) "In computer science, the longest palindromic substring or longest symmetric factor problem is the problem of finding a maximum-length contiguous substring of a given string that is also a palindrome. For example, the longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

# Brute force
This is the first solution that came to me.  It is like solving a very simple math problem.  
* You first understand what does the problem exactly ask for.
* Put the requirements in math terms.  
* Then test it on one or two basic cases.
* Work out the generalization. 

1. Let the length of the string be $n$.  Assume the longest is the entire string, check if it is palindrom. If yes, then done. Else continue to step 2
2. Check on continuous chunks of length $n-1$, and iterate through them. Say the string is "abcd", then the iterations are: "abc", and "bcd". There are 4-3+1 of them. We generalize it to $n - checkLength +1$.  If any of them is palindrom, then we are done.  Else continue.

```py
def checkPalindrome(s):
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
def max_Palindrome(s):
    for checkLength in range(len(s),0,-1):
        print("checkLength is ", checkLength)
        for start_index in range(0, len(s)+1-checkLength):
            print("start_index is ", start_index)
            if checkPalindrome(s[start_index: start_index+checkLength]):
                return s[start_index: start_index+checkLength]
max_Palindrome("aba")
# Out:
# checkLength is  3
# start_index is  0
# 'aba'
max_Palindrome("bananas")
# Out:
# checkLength is  7
# start_index is  0
# checkLength is  6
# start_index is  0
# start_index is  1
# checkLength is  5
# start_index is  0
# start_index is  1
# Out[18]: 'anana'
```

# Clever ways

The brute force method works. Now we try to find improvements.  
1. Can we loop through once instead of double loop?
2. Since we are looking for the longest, then if we find one of length m, then we can immediately go to check on m+1 length ones
