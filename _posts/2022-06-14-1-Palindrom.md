Quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20longest,bananas%22%20is%20%22anana%22.) "In computer science, the longest palindromic substring or longest symmetric factor problem is the problem of finding a maximum-length contiguous substring of a given string that is also a palindrome. For example, the longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

# Brute force
What came to my mind first is a brute force method.  

The method is like solving a very simple math problem.  
* You first _understand what does the problem exactly ask for_.
* **Put the requirements in math terms!**  
* Then _test it on one or two basic cases to really understand the problem and solution_.  Because it is hard to think only think with abstractions.  
* Work out the **generalization**. 

1. Let the length of the string be $$n$$.  Assume the longest is the entire string, check if it is palindrom. If yes, then done. 
2. If the entire string is not a palindrom, then we decrease check length by 1:  check on continuous chunks of length $$n-1$$, and iterate through them. Say the string is "abcd", then the iterations are: "abc", and "bcd". There are $$4-3+1$$ of them. We generalize the number of substrings with length $$x$$ to $$n - X +1$$.  If any of them is palindrom, then we are done.  Else continue.

```py
def checkPalindrome(s):
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
def max_Palindrome(s):
    for checkLength in range(len(s),0,-1):
        print("checkLength is ", checkLength)
        for start_index in range(0, len(s)+1-checkLength):
            print("start_index is ", start_index)
            if checkPalindrome(s[start_index: start_index+checkLength]):
                return s[start_index: start_index+checkLength]
max_Palindrome("aba")
# Out:
# checkLength is  3
# start_index is  0
# 'aba'
max_Palindrome("bananas")
# Out:
# checkLength is  7
# start_index is  0
# checkLength is  6
# start_index is  0
# start_index is  1
# checkLength is  5
# start_index is  0
# start_index is  1
# Out[18]: 'anana'
```

# Clever ways

The brute force method works. Now we try to find improvements.  
1. Can we loop through once instead of double loop?
2. Since we are looking for the longest, then if we find one of length m, then we can immediately go to check on m+1 length ones
