Languages we use can help or hinder our thinking. 

When we are working in different worlds, we need to simplify the words used without 1 million jargons.  We simplily cannot work with 1 million jargons in banking,1 million jargons in derivatives, 1 million jargons in insurance,1 million jargons in computer algorithm, and another million of jargons from statistics and machine learning.  Oh, what a mouthful! 

Euler was able to make leaps and bounds in mathematics to a certain degree because of his use of symbols and simple notations.  

Mathematics relies on simplifications.  

# Bets
A lot of financial products are bets. 
## Forward
Forward is agreeing to buy/sell something at sometime in the future at a price.  

**Buyer vs. seller**
**Agreed price vs. market price** at the time

Forwards are the riskiest financial contracts. 


PSE: our position in the deal is long. So client will owe us when it rises.  When it is strongr than ..., then the client owe us.  Then we have credit risk. 

PSE is $400 million.  Is it a lot or not?  I am afraid that number tells me absolutely nothing.  Need 2 more things:
1. Forward rate used for calculating the PSE, i.e. PSE rate
2. Volatility used for calculating the PSE
   
Is it on the low or high, or about right.  Then we know how much risk we are taking. PSE
