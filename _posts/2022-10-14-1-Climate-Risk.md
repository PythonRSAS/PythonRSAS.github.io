The more that people say the world is going to end, [...], the more times the word "climate catastrophy" is mentioned around the world, the higher and higher risk assets go.  What's going on?   

Climate-related financial risks, referred to throughout this site as simply climate risk, are the financial risks linked to climate change. Note that climate models may be totally wrong, and there is large variance between the predictions.

Statistics are based on quarterly regulatory filings. Statistics are inclusive of BHCs' nonbank subsidiaries. 

# Two types of climate risk

Below is a summary of the three accounting classifications of bank assets:

**Physical risk**: Securities (debt and equity) that are bought and held for the purpose of selling in the near term. They are reported at fair value.  *** Physical risks can have strong direct effects, but also indirect ones through supply chains, legal liability, or systemic and second-order effects.***. 

It splits physical risk in two subtypes: acute and chronic.

**Transition risk**: 
 It splits transition risk into four subtypes: policy and legal, technology, market, and reputational.

• What's both exciting and frightening is the economic transformation required to reach climate change targets, which is a source of transition risk, is huge and unprecedented in speed and scale.  

• Transition risks manifest not only through **policies** but also from **technological change**, **reputational risk**, and **market risk**.
The equivalent drivers of transition risk include factors such as tighter government policies to reduce emis-sions (e.g., through carbon taxes), technological changes (e.g., cheaper renewables making fossil fuel–based power generation less economical by comparison), and consumer pressures for sustainable products. 

• Climate risk transmits into the economy through corporate and financial balance sheets and consumer spend-ing patterns; however, the effects vary significantly by sector.

Roumeen Islam wrote, “The carbon tax on fuel aims to restructure economies by raising the cost of a critical resource- the juice that makes them run. But restructuring takes time as people, capital and other resources do not flow seamlessly into new sectors.”

Some of the resources used in other sectors will flow into the renewable energy and supporting sectors where both investment and jobs will increase. Yet, this too, will not automatically and immediately make up for disinvestment in fossil fuels, as is already evident. Supply- demand mismatches will happen in the short run. Add to this substantial uncertainty regarding several economic variables, such as the size of fuel reserves, the size of stranded assets, the harshness of winter, the future direction of climate policy, the pace of innovation in the renewables sector, or demand risk, and it is clear how economic disruption may be magnified.  

# Stranded asset- Coal
Good intentions can have disastrous consequences. 

From the standard climate risk text from media, we read that a coal-fired power plant or a steel plant, would be exposed to tighter climate policy, such as a higher carbon price.  This has not yet happened.  

Climate risk can affect financial balance sheets and lead to losses through standard channels such as diminished asset valuations or increased loan defaults. Sounds scary.   But the worst of the "standed assets", coal, prices have been goingup for the last year.  

![coal prices](../images/posts/coal_prices.PNG)

The coal prices bottomed in 2015-2016, like most commodities.  Then it went bottom again in August 2020, and then it rose to all time high...

According to [IMF](https://www.iea.org/news/global-coal-demand-is-set-to-return-to-its-all-time-high-in-2022), 
for many countries where coal remains a key fuel for electricity generation and a range of industrial processes. At the same time, the world’s continued burning of large amounts of coal is heightening climate concerns, as coal is the largest single source of energy-related CO2 emissions. 

Global coal demand is being propped up this year by rising natural gas prices, which have intensified ***gas-to-coal*** switching in many countries, as well as economic growth in India. 

Several EU countries are extending the life of coal plants scheduled for closure, reopening closed plants or raising caps on their operating hours to reduce gas consumption. However, Europe only accounts for about 5% of global coal consumption.

So it seems that reality is quite different from what was predicted about "stranded asset".

# Stranded physical assets
Physical risks can equally create stranded assets.   Unlike stranded assets due to transition risk, which are likely to be more concentrated in the energy and industrial sectors (we shall see), stranding due to physical risk can occur **across nearly all sectors**, but it is more likely to be concentrated geographically: for example, sea level rise and increased coastal 
 
# goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.
The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the goals of the Paris Agreement of 2015 to keep the average global temperature rise “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and to “pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.
5°C” (UNFCCC, 2015).

To reach net-zero emissions—a goal, many countries have set for themselves to reach by 2050. However, some countries have set slightly earlier goals (for example, Finland has set a goal for 2035), and some countries have set slightly later goals (for example, China has a goal for 2060), and there are other jurisdictions that have not yet made any net-zero commitments.

[TCFD](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/about/) recommends that firms should disclose on four key parameters, ranging from the concrete to the abstract, so that stake-holders are aware of the progress the firms have made in their preparedness to tackle climate change. These are metrics and targets, that is, the metrics used by the firm in question to assess climate-related risks and opportunities; risk management, that is, what processes the firm has in place to manage climate risks; the firm’s strategy surrounding climate change; and the


# Physical risk

Acute and chronic hazards. 

The former includes weather-related or weather-exacerbated events, whose incidence are increasing with climate change, such as floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. 

The latter includes gradual, long-term trends such as rising average temperatures and sea levels. 


But for both kinds of risk to become manifest, hazards (or driving factors) are not enough alone. 

In the face of these hazards and factors, different kinds of assets and companies will have differing levels of exposure and vulnerability. Exposure, here, is used in the classic financial sense of assets or firms that are in a vulnerable place or setting. A factory or warehouse in a low-lying coastal area would be exposed to sea level rise, and consequently so would the firm that owns the factory. 

Vulnerability—a concept linked to notions of resilience, flexibility, and adaptation—is less of a focus in traditional financial risk, but it is integral to considerations of climate risk, especially physical climate risk. It refers to the propensity or predisposition of the asset (or firm) to suffer adversely from its exposure to hazards. At the facility level, vulnerability to physical climate risk typically depends on physical infrastruc-ture: for example, of two neighboring factories in a flood zone, only one may have flood pumps installed. Vulnerability can also be discussed at the facility level for transition risk, referring to the ease of reducing or eliminating emissions—for instance, through conversion to hydrogen-based production—as opposed to having to pre-maturely close a facility, thus stranding it (see Section 3.2.1). At the corporate level, vulnerability can refer to the lack of preparation for such issues as climate change mitigation and adaptation planning, or it can apply to a lack of financial resilience, such as through insurance-based mechanisms. Overall, the interaction between hazards or drivers, expo-sures, and vulnerability then produces the overall effect of climate risk (see Figure 3.1).

Stranded Assets The notion of stranded assets is particularly important in the context of climate risk, and it has grown to be an impor-tant focus of research and analytical efforts in recent years to better understand climate, environmental, and broader sustainability risks. Stranded assets are assets that have “suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities” (Caldecott, 2013).

The concept of assets being left behind by external forces, leading to reduced valuations or complete write-downs, is not new, and it links to the idea of creative destruction. While the metaphor is obviously a physical one, the concept was first significantly applied to climate risk in the early 2010s in relation to the notion of “unburnable carbon” (for example, known oil or coal reserves that cannot be fully exploited if the agreed goals of limiting warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are to be met, thus making coal mines or oilfields into “stranded assets”). From there, the concept extended quite naturally to high-emitting industrial assets such as coal-fired power plants (see Section 3.4.1) or steel plants. The concept of stranded assets still refers most commonly to these assets with high transition risk, though the definition has been steadily expanding.
