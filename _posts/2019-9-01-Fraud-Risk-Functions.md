In most sports, such as basketball, it takes both good offense and good defense to win.  Same is in business.  We can analogize the fraud protection as defense.

Higher business growth and better customer service, lower fraud rates than competitors, and optimal operational overhead.  Balancing the three is the goal of  fraud risk management.  

This can only be achieved by having good partnership with internal and external teams, and by having excellent 360 fraud risk functions.

This takes great effort and hard work.  

> **Fraud risk team**

Like the best sports players, to win, the fraud risk team must be very skillful in technology and strategy. 


> **Processes and procedures**

One of the myths of great defense in sports is that players must be fast and quick to be effective defenders.
In fact, the best defense is played with anticipation and awareness of what’s going on around you, good body balance and basic fundamentals.


Same is true in fraud prevention.  

The fraud prevention process include the following for knowing what's going on:

* Real-time protections: customer authentication,identification and verification; 
* Transaction monitoring for all contact channels – internet, telephone, mobile, digital and in-person – to gain a holistic customer view.  
* One consistent and unified view across checks, debit cards, credit cards, ACH, wire transfers, deposits, merchant transactions and digital/online payments, which can also add value for anti-money laundering (AML), credit risk management, marketing and sales efforts, because ctivities that look normal by themselves can appear suspicious when seen in broader context. 
* One-time passwords or biometrics for strong customer authentication. Geolocation capability and device ID analysis for mobile and digital banking. 
* Feedback, investigations and recovery: machine learning analysis, fraud case review, root cause analysis, 
* Investigations and recovery, Network and link analytics for detecting collusion and for AML analysis and investigations. 
* Wallet provisioning
* Data visualization dashboards for identifying potentially suspicious events and connections. Reporting and management information 

> **Implementing the analytic fraud risk function**

Implementation should have openness and flexibility in the technology architecture and an API approach so that functions can be extended rather than having to replace.


The fraud technology should span account opening, transaction monitoring and network analysis, with broad data sharing and supported by analytics-driven rules and models.
