Accounting is a complicated topic.  This post tries to summarize the types of accounting classifications on bank assets and impacts on reclassification.

# Accounting classifications of bank assets

Below is a summary of the three accounting classifications of bank assets:
**Trading**: Securities (debt and equity) that are bought and held for the purpose of selling in the near term. They are reported at fair value.  **Unrealized gains and losses are included in the earnings**. 

**Held to maturity (HTM)**: Debt securities that the firm has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. (Equities can’t be included in this category since they don’t mature.)   They are reported at **amortized cost**.  

**Available for sale (AFS)**: A catch-all for debt and equity securities not captured by either of the above definitions. These are securities that the bank may retain for long periods but that may also be sold.  Often, they are held in the Treasury department of large banks.  The types of securities may include: US Treasury, sovereign debt, MBS, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and so on.  They are reported at **fair value**.  However, **unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings**. Unrealized gains/losses are reported in a separate component of shareholders equity. 

Because of the different accounting treatments, in particular, 
# Reclassifying

Since AFS is a catch-all category, that means that banks can move assets in or out of the AFS to the other ones when the intent has changed.  For example, HTM to AFS and vice versa. Why?  Mostly to stablize earnings. 

### AFS
The **U.S. Treasury Securities category** within AFS has been growing since the GFC, whereas the **U.S. Government Agency Obligations** category has been dropping during the same period of time. 

When combined with the **U.S. State and Municipal Debt** category, the three together went from slighly below **5% of total assets** to slightly above 5%.  As a group they are very steady. 

**AFS as a whole decreased** the most (slope the steepest) after 2003 until the GFC.   Was it **due to rising rates** of that period?  

We expect to see reduced AFS in 2022 as the Fed has been increasing rates.  Indeed, even with 1 quarter of the data in 2022, we see that AFS has dropped.
