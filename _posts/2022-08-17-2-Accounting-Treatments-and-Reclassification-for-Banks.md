# Accounting classifications of bank assets

**Trading**: Securities that are bought and held for the purpose of selling in the near term.

**Held to maturity (HTM)**: Debt securities that the firm has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. (Equities can’t be included in this category since they don’t mature.)

**Available for sale (AFS)**: A catch-all for debt and equity securities not captured by either of the above definitions. These are securities that the bank may retain for long periods but that may also be sold.
