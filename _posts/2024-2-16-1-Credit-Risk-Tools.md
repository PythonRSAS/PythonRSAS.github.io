Wholesale credit analysis is a very labor intensive process.  Although there are many quantitative models, so far real intelligence analyzing the financials is still the most effective method.  This is because there are so many different things that can affect a company differently from another one in a different industry, or even in the same industry. 


# The credit industry
Debt (or credit) can be categorized in 4 groups: government, financial sector, non-financial companies, and , households, which are often loosely divided into retail (aka “consumer”) and commercial, where retail is smaller loans to individuals or small business loans, whereas commercial means lending to businesses, high net worth individuals and sovereigns.   The credit industry is very dynamic and complex, interconnected with government policy, geopolitical risk, macroeconomic enviroment, credit cycle, and idiosyncratic risks.

## Cash Flow Measures ##
In wholesale credit analysis, it is important to analyze cash flow.  

EBITDA is one of the most important measures of profitability (eg. EBITDA margin = EBITDA/revenue). 

Charlie Munger famously said that he dislike EBITDA because interest rate and taxes are real expenses that a business must pay.  For equity investors, EBITDA may not be a good measure of how good a company is at making money.   But for banks, EBITDA is often used.  This is because interest is the piece that goes to the bank, and that tax liablities are usually not very signficant.
