Wholesale credit analysis is a very labor intensive process.  Although there are many quantitative models, so far real intelligence analyzing the financials is still the most effective method.  This is because there are so many different things that can affect a company differently from another one in a different industry, or even in the same industry. 

# Definitions

|  Term   | Calculation  |
|:------- |:-------- |
|Operating income | Sales - COGS (including despreciation) - SG&A - other operating expense + other operating income|
|EBIT | Income before taxes + interest expense|
|EBITDA | Net i ncome before taxes + interest expense + depreciation & amortization|
|Capital | Total debt + minority interest + preferred stock + owners' equity|



| **Operating income** | 


## Cash Flow Measures ##
In wholesale credit analysis, it is important to analyze cash flow.  

EBITDA is one of the most important measures of profitability (eg. EBITDA margin = EBITDA/revenue). 

Charlie Munger famously said that he dislike EBITDA because interest rate and taxes are real expenses that a business must pay.  For equity investors, EBITDA may not be a good measure of how good a company is at making money.   But for banks, EBITDA is often used.  This is because interest is the piece that goes to the bank, and that tax liablities are usually not very signficant.

|  Name   | Calculation  | What it Measures  | How to Use   |
|:------- |:-------- |:------- |:-------- |
| **EBITDA**   | Income before taxes + interest expense + D&A |**Near-cash operating income**; Igores other non-cash items, changes in working capital, and capex. May include non-operatingincome & expenses    | Profitability, leverage, and coverage analysis; Multiples valueation; Debt covenants|
