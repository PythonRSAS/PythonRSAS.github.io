# Review
Arrays have the following time complexity
1. **Access**: random access use *index* as all elements are indexed, run time is $$O(1)$$.  This is the advantage of arrays. 
2. Search:  $$O(n)$$, may need to go over each element to find an item from an unsorted array
3. Insert:  $$O(n)$$, because we need to shift the elements, which are after the index where we want to insert the item, to the *'right'* for one space  
4. Delete:  $$O(n)$$, because we need to shift the elements, which are after the index where we want to insert the item, to the *"left"* for one space  


Action | syntax
---------|----------
 instantiating 1D array| <span class="coding"> [0,1,2,3,4]</span>,  <span class="coding">list(range(5))</span>
 instantiating 2D array| <span class="coding"> [[0,1,2,3,4],[1,2], [0]]</span>, also called "nested list"
 access |  <span class="coding">[0]</span> gives the first element,  <span class="coding">[~0] </span> reverse access| 
 append |  <span class="coding">.append() </span>
 insert |   <span class="coding">.insert(2,100)</span>
 reverse |  <span class="coding">.reverse()</span> in-place, or <span class="coding">reversed(list)</span> returns an iterator

## Slicing
Since accessing array is an $$O(1)$$ operation, it is important to know how to access elements via slicing using <span class="coding">:</span> the slicing operator and other directional operators <span class="coding">-</span> and, to a less extent, <span class="coding">~</span> (reverse direction). 
* <span class="coding">[x:y:z]</span>:
  begin at x, 
  end at y-1, 
  step size z.  
For example <span class="coding">[5:1:-2]</span>  means begin at index 5, end at index 1, with step size -2, i.e. the indices sliced are: 5, 3



# Leetcode 2289. Steps to Make Array Non-decreasing

Problem: You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one step, remove all elements nums[i] where nums[i - 1] > nums[i] for all 0 < i < nums.length.

Return the number of steps performed until nums becomes a non-decreasing array.

Input: nums = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the steps performed:
- Step 1: [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11] becomes [5,4,4,7,6,11,11]
- Step 2: [5,4,4,7,6,11,11] becomes [5,4,7,11,11]
- Step 3: [5,4,7,11,11] becomes [5,7,11,11]
[5,7,11,11] is a non-decreasing array. Therefore, we return 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,7,7,13]
Output: 0

Solution:
This problem took me some thinking. 

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>steps_to_non_decreasing_array.py</div>

```py
def getIndex(A):
    idx = []
    for i in range(0, len(A)-1):
        if A[i] > A[i+1]:
            idx.append(i+1)
    print("Indices to be removed ", idx)
    return ([A[i] for i in range(len(A)) if not i in idx], idx)

def steps(A):
    temp, idxRemove = getIndex(A)
    if idxRemove:
        ct = 1
    else:
        ct = 0
        return ct
    while idxRemove:
        temp, idxRemove = getIndex(temp)
        if idxRemove:
            ct += 1
    return ct
nums = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
print(getIndex(nums))
print(steps(nums))
# Indices to be removed  [1, 5, 8, 9]
# Indices to be removed  [1, 4]
# Indices to be removed  [1]
# Indices to be removed  []
# 3
nums = [4,5,7,7,13]
print(getIndex(nums))
print(steps(nums))
# Indices to be removed  []
# ([4, 5, 7, 7, 13], [])
# Indices to be removed  []
# 0
```

## Partitioning problem
We want to partition an array in the following fashion:
Given an element called "pivot" (or the index of it) of the array of integers,  the ones smaller than this number should be placed before this number, and the ones larger than this number after. 

The following solution has time complexity $$O(n)$$ and space complexity $$O(1)$$.  I did this problem a few times.  There are 4 places I found myself making mistakes:
1. indent of the return (or forgot to return)
2. compare with the pivot, not anything else
3. the direction of the range
4. forgot to increment/decrement the pointer indices

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>partition.py</div>

```py
def partition(pivot_idx, A):
    pivot = A[pivot_idx]
    N = len(A)
    small_idx = 0
    big_idx = N - 1
    print("Pivot is ",A[pivot_idx])
    # move smaller ones to the front
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] < pivot:
            A[i], A[small_idx] = A[small_idx], A[i]
            small_idx += 1

    # move bigger ones to the front
    for i in reversed(range(N)):
        if A[i] < pivot:
            break
        if A[i] > pivot:
            A[i], A[big_idx] = A[big_idx], A[i]
            big_idx -= 1

    return A
lt = [0, 1,2,0,2,1,1]
print(partition(3,lt))
```
