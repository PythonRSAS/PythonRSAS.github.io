## Leetcode 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations 
Super easy. 

* Problem:
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

* Example 1:

Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.

* Constraints:

1 <= operations.length <= 100
operations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".

```python
def operations(A):
    res = 0
    for i in A:
        if i in ["X++","X++"]:
            res += 1
        else:
            res -= 1
    return res

A = ["--X","X++","X++"]
print(operations(A))
```

## Leetcode 1672. Richest Customer Wealth- Max sum of subarrays
You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

* Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6

* Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10

* Solution:
Although this is super easy, one should never be careless. It is asking for the maximum of the sums of the subarrays.
We can solve it with one line.
```python
def maxSubSum(A):
    return max([sum(i) for i in accounts])
print(maxSubSum(A))
```
Or we can do it using a for-loop.  

```python
def maxSubSum(A):
    res = 0
    for i in A:
        ith_sum = sum(i)
        if ith_sum > res:
            res = ith_sum
    return res

accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
print(maxSubSum(accounts))
```
