# Problem
Given a directed hierchical structure, how do we flatten it to an array so that the directions are preserved?  

Recall my problem of trying to fly to Beijing, China, while Zero-Covid policy is going on in China, say I have combed through many many flights (edges) and stops (nodes) and have come up with the following possible path.  

![](../images/posts/myTrip.PNG)

How do I write down each of the valid routes in their right order with sentences? 

Before quoting any named algorithm, how would we solve the problem? 

We can write down my starting place first, since it does not have any dependencies. Then we look at where the directed edges lead to, if any of them do not have any dependencies, then we can write it down next. And so forth until we are done. 

My solution seems to resemble Khan's algorithm for topological sort: solving problem layer by layer: start from those that have no dependencies (no incoming edges), remove them and write them down (put them in a queue). Do it to the next batch.

Below images are taken from Washington University Professor Rao's CSE 326 Lecture 20.  The problem is similar, except names of cities have become course numbers.  We want to write down the list of course in their dependency order.

Here is a different way posing a similar problem:

  else:                        # else

# Cycle detection

Khan's algorithm of topological sort can be used for cycle detection.    

## Leetcode 207. Course Schedule

**Problem**:  There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where $$prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]$$ indicates that you must take course $$b_i$$ first if you want to take course $$a_i$$.  For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1. Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

* Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]

Output: true

* Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]

Output: false.  This is because to take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1.  So it is impossible.

Code for plotting the directed group. If we want undirected graph, use <span class="coding">nx.Graph()</span> instead. 
<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>simple directed graph.py</div>

```py
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edge(0, 1)
G.add_edge(0, 2)
G.add_edge(1, 3)
G.add_edge(1, 4)
G.add_edge(3, 4)
# explicitly set positions
pos = {0: (-4, 0), 2: (1, -2), 1: (3, 0),  3: (10, 0), 4: (12, -2)}
options = {
    "font_size": 36,

    "node_color": "white",
    "edgecolors": "black",
    "linewidths": 5,
    "width": 5,

# Set margins for the axes so that nodes aren't clipped
ax = plt.gca()
ax.margins(0.20)
