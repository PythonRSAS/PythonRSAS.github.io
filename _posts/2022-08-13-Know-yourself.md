The behavioral portion of the interview allows the team to better understand how you work and what motivates you professionally.

Know yourself. Take the time to review your own resume as your interviewer will almost certainly ask questions about key events in your work history.

Be honest. Not every project is a runaway success and we may not always interact perfectly with our peers. Being transparent in these situations won't be counted against you in the interview. In fact, sharing and discussing how you learned, improved and grew from your past experiences is valued.

Use the S.T.A.R. (Situation, Task, Actions, Results) method to mentally organization your thoughts. This will provoke a well thought-out and chronological action of events. Easy to describe, easy to follow.

Have concrete examples or anecdotes. Support each question with practical experiences and examples. Avoid theoretical answers - if you go into a theoretical tangent, your interviewer will redirect you to provide a concrete example.

Some typical behavioral interview questions are:

* What are some of the best things you've built?
  
One of the best things I have built is a family of models that were successfully implemented.  This series of models are fundamental to our department.   The key components to the success are:
1. Learned from great products that other companies have built already: stand on the shoulders of giants
2. Mathematics
3. Automation + business intuition
4. Talk with business experts and get their feedback. 
   For example, using e-commerce/non-e-commerce was my innovation.  But to look at e-commerce was suggested by a a credit approver. 

* What are you most proud of?
  My ability to focus on priorities, and ability to turn around difficult situations. 


* What could you have done better?
  I could have a more balanced life, used regular exercises to reduce stress.  Healthy mind and body is essential for long term success in work and life. 
  
* What were some excellent collaborations you've had?
* Tell me about a time when you advocated for and pushed your own ideas forward despite opposition.
  
* How do you deal with conflict?
  In a large corporate, I have experienced different kinds of conflicts.
  1. Technical
  2. Between peers
   
* How do you like to give and receive feedback?
* What kinds of technologies are you most excited about?


Be yourself. This means being open and honest about your successes and failures.

**Be humble** and focus on teamwork, leadership, and mentorship qualities.
