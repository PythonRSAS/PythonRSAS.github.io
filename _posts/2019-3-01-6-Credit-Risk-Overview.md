At any given moment, there are hundreds of trillions of debt or credit.  This fantastic visualization (even though outdated) provides a sense of the scale and the relative scale of credit: [All of the World’s Money and Markets in One Visualization](https://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/)


> **Credit risk** is the **uncertainty** associated with some event, where the event is specifically about whether the borrower will pay back the money borrowed, and how much. 

In a broader context, credit risk exists in every industry, and concerns every company and individual in every industry even though the term credit is usually associated with money borrowing. Every business that wants to scale succesfully needs to have good management on their credit risk.  

The uncertainty can be examined in many ways. What is in common across different industries are the following two questions:
1.  How likely is something going to happen
2.  If it happens, what is the impact

### The credit industry
Debt (or credit) can be categorized in 4 groups: government, financial sector, non-financial companies, and , households, which are often loosely divided into retail (aka “consumer”) and commercial, where retail is smaller loans to individuals or small business loans, whereas commercial means lending to businesses, high net worth individuals and sovereigns.   The credit industry is very dynamic and complex, interconnected with government policy, geopolitical risk, macroeconomic enviroment, credit cycle, and idiosyncratic risks. 

Below is a summary of the different products or portfolios: 
### Consumer ###
•	Credit cards
•	Deposit/attritions
•	Auto loans
•	Student loans
•	Installment
•	Residential mortgages
### Commercial
•	Commercial and industrial (C&I)
•	Commercial real estate (CRE)
•	Land and Construction
•	Non-bank financial institution (NBFI)
•	Project finance
•	Shipping and aircraft
•	Small business
•	Banks
•	Sovereign

### Credit cycles: the best of the time, the worst of time; vice versa

Credit, as part of the economic enviroment, has cycles.  When economy is booming, it is easy to borrow and start businesses.  When economy is in hard times, businesses go under and it is difficult to borrow.

The irony, due to the cycles, is that the best of the time often creates the worst of lending, and the worst time can often create new opportunites. 

Explain a bit more on the first part: what this saying means is that the worst loans are often originated from the best of time.  When economy is good, even those company with strong risk management and disciplined underwriting principles cannot help relaxing their credit risk standards, as a result of tempation of profit and pressure from peers and/or shareholders.  

The knighted businessperson will retire or leave when or before the storm comes.  If they leave before the music stops, they get huge paybacks and lots of recognitions. 

In credit risk modeling, loan vintage, or origination time, matters.  Those loans that were given out just right before financial crisis started had the worst recovery due to the relaxed credit standard, and the stress period that followed.

### Managing credit risk: qualitative insights, techonology, analytics, the only thing that is better than data is more data

> I learned this from my friend Professor David Belanger (former chief scientist at AT&T), who might have quoted someone, that "the only thing better than data is more data".  

**Data**:  What I want to add is that data is not limited to those existing in databases or alternative databases or social media databases.  The kind of data that resides in individual's mental databases are the qualitative sides that are difficult or impossible to capture in quantitative databases. 

If we look at the all the public companies that specializes in managing data and providing insights from their data, we notice that they have all done well in the last ten years, in comparison with the rest.  For example:Google,Facebook,Moody's,S&PGlobal,Verisk,Salesforce,Equifax. If we can extrapolate, whether the computing power + analytics can deliver more incremental value will determine whether these companies will continue to outshine others.  

Collecting more data (wider and longer), knowing how to organize and manage them is the foundation to the growth.   Those who ignore this mantra have been penalized heavily (check out a few on their stock performance if they are still around). 

There is often an asymmetry of information both in consumer space and commercial space: credit providers do not know a lot about the credit receivers other than what have been provided, researched, and possibly some additional alternative data.   
* **Fraud** - Each year, the top 20 retail banks in the US loses $50 Billion to fraud. 
* **Bankruptcy** - about 50% of total losses of retail loans in financial institutions are from bankruptcy losses.   Why those bankruptcies happened and why they were not detected early on implies that financial institutions still do not know enough about what they don't know.

**Analytics**:  For complex data that contains intricate interactions, and very non-linear data, traditional methodologies such as generalized linear regression (GLM), which includes logistic regression, a staple in credit scoring for years, just do not deliver the kind of accuracy that machine learning models do.   

Of course, machine learning models predictions need to be well tested and understood before being used to make important credit decisions, especially when it is in a regulated institution.
