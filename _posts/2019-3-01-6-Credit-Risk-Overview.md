At any given moment, there are hundreds of trillions of debt or credit.  You can have a look at this fantastic visualization to get a sense: [All of the World’s Money and Markets in One Visualization](https://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/)


> **Credit risk** is the **uncertainty** associated with some event, where the event is specifically about whether the borrower will pay back the money borrowed, and how much. 

In a broader context, credit risk exists in every industry, and concerns every company and individual in every industry even though the term credit is usually associated with money borrowing. Every business that wants to scale succesfully needs to have good management on their credit risk.  

The uncertainty can be examined in many ways. What is in common across different industries are the following two questions:
1.  How likely is something going to happen
2.  If it happens, what is the impact

Debt (or credit) can be categorized in 4 groups: government, household, financial sector and non-financial companies.

### Credit cycles: the best of the Time, the worst of Time; the worst of time, the best of time

What this saying means is that the worst loans are often originated from the best of time.  When economy is good, even those company with strong risk management and disciplined underwriting principles cannot help relaxing their credit risk standards, as a result of tempation of profit and pressure from peers and/or shareholders.  

The knighted business person will retire or leave when or before the storm comes.  If they leave before the music stops, they get huge paybacks and lots of recognitions. 

In credit risk modeling, loan vintage, or origination time, matters.  Those loans that were given out just right before financial crisis started had the worst recovery due to the relaxed credit standard, and the stress period that followed.


* **Fraud** - Each year, the top 20 retail banks in the US loses $50 Billion to fraud. 
* **Bankruptcy** - about 50% of total losses of retail loans in financial institutions are from bankruptcy losses.   Why those bankrupcies happened and why they were not detected early on implies that financial institutions still do not know enough about what they don't know.

### the credit industry

The realm of money borrowing is loosely divided into retail (aka “consumer”) and wholesale (aka “commercial”), where retail is smaller loans to individuals or small business loans, whereas wholesale means lending to businesses, high net worth individuals and sovereigns.   The credit industry is very dynamic and complex, interconnected with government policy, geopolitical risk, macroeconomic enviroment, credit cycle, and idiosyncratic risks. 

Below is a summary of the different products or portfolios: 
### Consumer ###
•	Credit cards
•	Deposit/attritions
•	Auto loans
•	Student loans
•	Installment
•	Residential mortgages
### Commercial
•	Commercial and industrial (C&I)
•	Commercial real estate (CRE)
•	Land and Construction
•	Non-bank financial institution (NBFI)
•	Project finance
•	Shipping and aircraft
•	Small business
•	Banks
•	Sovereign


### do you know what you don't know

> In insurance and credit, there is an asymmetry of information. This is more severe in consumer space than commercial space.  Insurers and lenders do not know a lot about the insured or borrower other than what have been provided, researched, and possibly some additional alternative data.   

### the Only Thing that is Better than Data is More Data

> I learned this from my friend Professor David Belanger (former chief scientist at AT&T), who might have quoted someone.  

If you look at the all the public companies that specializes in managing data and providing insights from their data, you will notice that they have all done well in the last ten years, in comparion with the rest. 

For example:
* **Google** 
* **Facebook**
* **Moody's**
* **Equifax**
* **S&P Global**
* **Verisk**
* **Salesforce** 

Collecting more data (wider and longer), knowing how to organize and manage them is the foundation to the growth.   Those who ignore this mantra have been penalized heavily (check out a few on their stock performance if they are still around). 

If we can extrapolate, whether the computing power + analytics can deliver more incremental value will determine whether these companies will continue to outshine others.  

### technology matters

> Technology is how we do things.   We all know the difference in speed between walking and flying.   There is technology in analytics. 

For complex data that contains intricate interactions, and very non-linear data, traditional methodologies such as genearalized linear regression (GLM), which includes logistic regression, a staple in credit scoring for years, just do not deliver the kind of accuracy that machine learning models do.   

Of course, machine learning models predictions need to be well tested and understood before being used to make important credit decisions, especially when it is in a regulated institution.
