# Common risk factors
Commercial real estate risks vary greatly by location and property type, and many idiosyncratic factors determine building-specific risks: if it is on the waterfront, amenities and updates, management, etc.  But there are some common factors.

1. LTV
   $$LTV=loan/property value$$
   The higher the LTV, the higher the risk.  Once LTV is bigger than 1, it becomes very risky. 

2. DSCR
   $$Net operating income/debt service coverage ratio$$
   
   The higher the DSCR, the better the deal, and smaller the default risk. 

    Sometimes even when LTV is larger than 1, but NOI is higher than interest payments, borrowers are willing to hold the property and continue the loan because it is profitable in terms of cash flow.

3. Loan contractual terms
   Recourse loans will have much lower expected loss severity than non-recourse loans.

4. Interest rates
   Floating rate loans will suffer a lot more in a rising inflationary enviroment.

   IO (interest-only) loans may have higher risks as well.  IO loans do not pay down principal overtime.  And the final payment is a balloon payment. If borrower cannot refinance at affordable terms then there is a strong default risk. 

5. Lease tems
   While hotel property type has an immediate response to macroeconomic shocks and disasters (e.g., 9/11 terror attack, Covid pandemic), offices and industrial property types often have long term leases, some are well over 10 years, and will show a lagged response to stress. 

   Private negotiations over lease terms may not be reflected in public data. 

# Inflationary enviroment and risks in CRE

Inflation enviroment could be a booming period for CRE if inflation is related to rapid economic growth.  

However, when inflation is caused by what we are having right now (too much stimulus, supply chain issue, not enough production, lower productivity), then inflation will negatively affect CRE. 

As eonomoy contracts and businesses cut down on spending, occupancy will drop.  Combined with higher construction costs and wages, NOI will drop.  Further, with rising rates, DSCR will drop.  Decreasing DSCR will push down property value, causing LTV to rise.  Overall default risks are higher.
