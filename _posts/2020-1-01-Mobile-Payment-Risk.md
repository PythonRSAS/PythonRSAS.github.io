Faster mobile payments through messaging, social media apps, payment apps, QR code, and even face scan give users a lot of convinience but also opens more room for fraud risk, which has been on the rise.   

There is a Chinese saying "道高一尺,魔高一丈".  The English translation is "While the priest climbs a post, the devil climbs ten." 

Each authentication 身份验证 method has its shortfalls.  Frausters can steal and fake finger prints or other types of unique IDs just like how they steal and fake passwords or checks.    A quick search will yield many sites that offer them for sale.  

While it is not possible to eliminate payment fraud, the risk can be minimized and contained by balancing multiple factors and better technology 更好的技术. 

> **Risk tolerance**

Risk tolerance needs to be set. 

Einstein once said “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler".   

Fraud prevention features need to balance user convenience and security 平衡便捷和安全.

More layers of authentication can affect user experience and cause frustrations from lock-outs.  So, have strong authentication, but not stronger. 

More private information collected about users will increase risk for data leak.  So, collect as much as needed, but not more. 

More false alerts increases costs of doing business.  So, set rules, thresholds and KPIs that raise enough alerts, but not more. 

It is important to establish the level of risk tolerance through understanding how much loss is tolerable for how much profit at particular amount of business. 

> **Partner with internal and external teams**

We know that the success of a business needs to balance 平衡 risk management with customer experience and operational overhead. 

Internal teams, such as product and marketing teams often are too excited in new product launches to appreciate the fraud risks.  

It is important to have a good working partnership with Engineering, Product, Operations and Compliance teams to conceive, design, and monitor fraud strategies and recommend product features in order to mitigate fraud risk in the most precise manner (simple but not simpler), collaborate on technology that will fit with the organization’s overall IT architecture and strategy, and to secure the funding and IT resources to implement fraud controls.

Externally, fraud risk team need to work with business partners and regulators. 

> **Fraud risk team**

Mobile payment risk management heavily involves technology.  

The fraud risk team invest in learning the latest technologies that can take anti-fraud to the next level.  For example, the combination of voice, iris, face scan 刷脸 and finger print scan 指纹识别is a step up in security and convenience than passwords. 

It should have data engineer/scientists, and people who are knowledgeable in investigations and have the sensitivity for identify and explore emerging risks.
