**Lessons:**
1. Try not to invest in foreign stocks or funds that contain foreign stocks in tax-free retirement funds such as ROTH, unless you know the foreign tax is not not too penalizing. 
2. The maximum capital loss that can be used for offset income is only $3000.  The remaining loss can be carried forward indefinitely. 
3. Qualified dividend in your brokerage account is taxed at 10%.  Dividend income in your IRA account is not taxed.  So, if you are in a state that does not have state tax on 

Qualified dividend income refers to dividends that meet specific criteria set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. To be considered qualified, dividends must be paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation. Additionally, the stock must be held for a certain period of time, usually more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date.

The tax treatment of qualified dividends is more favorable than that of ordinary dividends. As of my last update in January 2022, qualified dividends are taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates. This treatment is intended to encourage long-term investment in stocks by providing tax advantages to investors who hold onto their investments for an extended period.

It's important to note that tax laws can change, so it's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the latest IRS guidelines for the most up-to-date information on qualified dividend income.

**Total capital gain**
Total capital gain distributions represent the sum of all capital gains distributed to shareholders by a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) during a specific period, typically a year. These distributions are typically made when the fund sells securities within its portfolio at a profit.

Capital gain distributions can come in two forms:

1. Short-term capital gains: These are gains realized from the sale of assets held for one year or less. Short-term capital gains are typically taxed at ordinary income tax rates.

2. Long-term capital gains: These are gains realized from the sale of assets held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains are usually taxed at lower rates than short-term gains, depending on the investor's tax bracket.

Investors who own shares in a fund that distributes capital gains may be subject to taxes on these distributions, even if they have not sold any shares themselves. The tax treatment of capital gain distributions depends on various factors, including the type of account (e.g., taxable brokerage account, retirement account) and the investor's individual tax situation.

Investors should carefully consider the tax implications of capital gain distributions when investing in mutual funds or ETFs, and they may want to consult with a tax advisor for personalized guidance.

**FATCA Requirement**
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a U.S. law aimed at combating tax evasion by U.S. persons holding financial assets outside the United States. Under FATCA, certain taxpayers with specified foreign financial assets are required to report those assets to the IRS by filing Form 8938, "Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets," along with their annual income tax return.

The filing requirements for Form 8938 depend on various factors, including filing status, residency status, and the value of the taxpayer's specified foreign financial assets. Generally, individuals are required to file Form 8938 if they are:

1. A U.S. citizen, resident alien, or non-resident alien who meets the substantial presence test for the calendar year.
2. A nonresident alien who elects to be treated as a resident alien for tax purposes.

The thresholds for reporting specified foreign financial assets on Form 8938 vary depending on whether the taxpayer lives in the United States or abroad. For example, for taxpayers living in the United States, the reporting threshold is higher compared to those living abroad.

Specified foreign financial assets subject to reporting under FATCA include:

- Financial accounts held at foreign financial institutions
- Foreign stock or securities
- Foreign partnership interests
- Foreign mutual funds
- Certain foreign retirement accounts
- Foreign-issued life insurance or annuity contracts with a cash-value component

Failure to comply with FATCA reporting requirements may result in penalties imposed by the IRS.

It's essential for individuals with foreign financial assets to understand their FATCA reporting obligations and consult with a tax advisor if they have questions about their specific situation.


# Stock Sales Gains or Losses
Form 8949 is used to report sales and exchanges of capital assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certain other assets, for tax purposes. The information reported on Form 8949 is then transferred to Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR), which is used to calculate the taxpayer's capital gains and losses.

When filing your taxes, you typically enter the information from Form 8949 on Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). Here's a general overview of the process:

1. Complete Form 8949: Report each sale or exchange of a capital asset on Form 8949. You'll need to provide details such as the description of the property, the date acquired and sold, the sales price, the cost or other basis, and the gain or loss.

2. Transfer totals to Schedule D: After completing Form 8949, transfer the totals from each section of Form 8949 to the appropriate sections of Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). You'll need to categorize your capital gains and losses as short-term or long-term based on the holding period of each asset.

3. Calculate totals on Schedule D: On Schedule D, calculate the totals for all short-term gains and losses, as well as all long-term gains and losses. You'll then determine your net short-term and net long-term capital gains or losses.

4. Enter totals on Form 1040 or 1040-SR: Finally, enter the net capital gain or loss from Schedule D on the appropriate line of your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

If you're using tax preparation software or working with a tax professional, they will typically guide you through the process of entering information from Form 8949 onto Schedule D and your tax return. Make sure to carefully review your entries for accuracy before filing your taxes.

***Capital loss carryover lets you offset your ordinary income year after year, rather than just a single tax year***. So, we can only offset $3000 per year! 
This happens when two conditions are met:
Youâ€™ve maxed out the $3,000 capital loss limit ($1,500 each if Married Filing Separately), and
You have excess losses remaining that can be carried to future years

In the United States, you can typically carry forward capital losses indefinitely until they are fully used to offset capital gains or up to a certain limit each year. Here are the key points:

1. **Indefinite Carryforward**: Capital losses that are not fully utilized in the current tax year can be carried forward to future years indefinitely. This means you can use them to offset capital gains in future tax years.

2. **Annual Limitation**: While there is no limit on how many years you can carry forward capital losses, there is an annual limitation on how much of your capital losses you can use to offset other income in a given tax year. As of my last update, for individuals and married couples filing jointly, the annual limit is $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately).

3. **Prioritization of Uses**: When carrying forward capital losses, they are generally used to offset capital gains first. If there are any remaining losses after offsetting capital gains, up to the annual limit can be used to offset other income, such as wages or interest income.

4. **Use in the Year of Death**: If a taxpayer dies with unused capital losses, the remaining losses can be used to offset capital gains in the year of death. Any unused losses beyond that cannot be carried forward by the deceased taxpayer's estate or heirs.

5. **Tax Law Changes**: It's essential to note that tax laws regarding capital loss carryforwards can change, so it's important to stay updated on the current tax regulations and consult with a tax professional for personalized guidance.

Overall, capital loss carryforwards can be a valuable tax planning tool for individuals who have experienced investment losses, allowing them to offset future gains and potentially reduce their tax liability over time.
