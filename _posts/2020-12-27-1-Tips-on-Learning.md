It is year end of 2020, time to reflect. 

Simple tips on how to be accomplished.  It is consistenly making progress.  It is get up where you fall, and try not to rework if possible. 

**1. Focus on priorities**

**2. Persistence**

**3. Use shortcuts**

# Focus on priorities
First thing in the morning, or the night before, put down the top 1, 2 or 3 things that are the most important. 
Do not check emails before 9 am. 

Before 10 am, do nothing but the top most important thing until it is complete.
If it is not done by 10 am, continue work on it until it is done. 

To me, taking **good notes and consistently organize** them is really important. For people who are constantly multitasking like myself (many of us have to multitask without a choice), notes help us switch from one task/skill/goal to another task/skill/goal quickly without wasting a lot of time to pick up things again. 


# Shortcuts
## Word
For a specific subject, I like to use *Word* for taking notes.  I have some keyboard shortcuts that help format text quickly.
- code: contrl + shift + Q
- normal text: contrl + shift + E
- insert image: alt, n, p, d
## Outlook
Very important tool for work!
