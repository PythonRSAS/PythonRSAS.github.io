In many Python code, there is a script at the end that starts with  <span class="coding">if \__name__ == '\__main__'</span>.  What it does is to check whether the code is being run from commandline, and if so, it will do certain things.  And if the code is not being run from the commandline, then it won't do those things. 

```python
def main():
    # my code
if __main__ =='__main__':
    main()
```

For example, I have a script called "dashboard.py" that I run first thing in the morning to pull and plot some of the latest financial data that I am interested in.  All I have to do the first time is to type "python dashboard.py" on commandline. 
```python
def dashboard():
    # my dashboard code
if __main__ =='__main__':
    main()
```

But what is the <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span>? 

For SAS users,at least that double underscore looks familiar.  SAS special variables, such as <span class="coding">\__n__</span>, <span class="coding">\_type_</span>, have double underscores.  

Python has special variables as well.    

When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines some special variables such as <span class="coding">\__builtin__</span> and <span class="coding">\__doc__</span>. <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span> is one of them.

The purpose of <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span> is to allow us to check if the scipt is being run directly.  The actions following <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span> is to happen only if the script is being run directly.  

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>learn_path.py</div>

```python
import os
def print_path():
    ABS_PATH = os.path.abspath(__file__)
    print("\n os.path.abspath(__file__) ", ABS_PATH)

    PARENT_PATH = os.path.dirname(ABS_PATH)
    print("\n os.path.dirname(ABS_PATH) ",PARENT_PATH)

    CHILD_PATH = os.path.basename(ABS_PATH)
    print("\n os.path.basename(ABS_PATH) ",CHILD_PATH)
if __name__ =='__main__':
    print_path()
```

```
(base) C:\>python C:\\Code_only\learn_path_main.py
```

Some explanations for the output below.  <span class="coding">os.path.abspath(__file__)</span> gives the full absolute path.  <span class="coding">os.path.dirname()</span> gives the parent folder path. <span class="coding">os.path.basename()</span> give the filename itself, i.e. the script name itself.

```
os.path.abspath(__file__)  C:\\Code_only\learn_path_main.py
os.path.dirname(ABS_PATH)  C:\\Code_only
os.path.basename(ABS_PATH)  learn_path_main.py
```

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>learn_main.py</div>

```python
>>> def run_time():
>>>     print("\nRun time action triggered by if __name__ == '__main__'")
>>> def action_at_import_time():
>>>     print("\nImport time action trigged by calling the function")
>>> action_at_import_time()
>>>
>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
>>>     # execute only if run as a script
>>>     run_time()
```

Now, open the command prompt, or Anaconda Prompt, type "python learn_main.py", as shown below, we will get the output as expected. Both the first and the second function ran.  The second function ran because the name of the module according to the Python interpreter, is <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span>. 

```python
python learn_main.py
Import time action trigged by calling the function

Run time action triggered by if __name__ == '__main__'
```

On the other hand, if a module is not the main program but is imported by another one, then <span class="coding">\__name__</span> attribute will be the name of the scirpt, in this case it is "learn_main", not <span class="coding">\__main__</span>.  Since the <span class="coding">\__name__</span> is not \__main__, then whatever \__main__ does will be ignored. 

This neat trick helps us reuse code more flexibly.
