In many Python code, there is a script at the end that starts with if <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span>.  It often appears in scripts that are intended to be reused/imported in other programs. 

In SAS, there are special variables, such as <span class="coding">\__n__</span>, <span class="coding">\_type_</span>, Python has special variables as well.    When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines some special variables such as <span class="coding">\__builtin__</span> and <span class="coding">\__doc__</span>. <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span> is another one of them.

The purpose of <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span> is to allow us to check if the scipt is being run directly.  The actions following <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span> is to happen only if the script is being run directly.  

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>learn_main.py</div>

```python
>>> def action_at_run_time():
>>>     print("\nRun time action triggered by if __name__ == '__main__'")
>>> def action_at_import_time():
>>>     print("\nImport time action trigged by calling the function")
>>> action_at_import_time()
>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
>>>     # execute only if run as a script
>>>     run_time()
```

Now, open the command prompt, or Anaconda Prompt, type "python learn_main.py", as shown below, we will get the output as expected. Both the first and the second function ran.  The second function ran because the name of the module according to the Python interpreter, is <span class="coding">\__name__ == '\__main__'</span>. 

```python
python learn_main.py
Import time action trigged by calling the function

Run time action triggered by if __name__ == '__main__'
```

On the other hand, if a module is not the main program but is imported by another one, then <span class="coding">\__name__</span> attribute will be the name of the scirpt, in this case it is "learn_main", not <span class="coding">\__main__</span>.  Since the <span class="coding">\__name__</span> is not \__main__, then whatever \__main__ does will be ignored. 

This neat trick helps us reuse code more flexibly.
