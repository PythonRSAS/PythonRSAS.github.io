In many Python code, there is a script at the end that starts with if <span class="coding">__name__ == '__main__'</span>.  It often appears in scripts that are intended to be reused/imported in other programs. 

In SAS, there are special variables, such as <span class="coding">__n__</span>, <span class="coding">__type__ == '__main__'</span>, Python has special variables as well.    When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines some special variables such as <span class="coding">__builtin__</span> and <span class="coding">__doc__</span>. <span class="coding">__name__ == '__main__'</span> is another one of them.

The purpose of <span class="coding">__name__ == '__main__'</span> is to allow us to check if the scipt is being run directly.  The actions following <span class="coding">__name__ == '__main__'</span> is to happen only if the script is being run directly.  

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>Tlearn_main.py</div>

```python
>>> def run_time():
>>>     print("\nRun time action triggered by if __name__ == '__main__'")
>>> def import_time():
>>>     print("\nImport time action trigged by calling the function")
>>> import_time()
>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
>>>     # execute only if run as a script
>>>     run_time()
```

```python
python learn_main.py
Import time action trigged by calling the function

Run time action triggered by if __name__ == '__main__'
```

On the other hand, if a module is not the main program but is imported by another one, then <span class="coding">__name__</span> attribute will be the name of the scirpt, for example "learn_main", not <span class="coding">__main__</sapn>.  Since the <span class="coding">__name__</span> is not __main__, then whatever __main__ does will be ignored.
