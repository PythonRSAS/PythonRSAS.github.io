A lot of times we are given PDFs to read.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could read the tables and analyze in Python?  

> Note: pip install tabula-py



## Read all document
<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>read all.py</div>

```python

import tabula

# Specify the path to your PDF file
pdf_path = r"C:/Users/sache/Downloads/Citi-2023-Annual-Report.pdf"
# Read tables from the PDF
tables = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_path, pages='all')

# Iterate through extracted tables
for table in tables:
    print(table)
```

But often we just need a specific table on a page.  For example, the document we are reading is a nearly 400 page Citigroup 2023 annual report. 

## Read one table to pandas
<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>read all.py</div>

```python

import tabula

# Specify the path to your PDF file
pdf_path = r"C:/Users/sache/Downloads/Citi-2023-Annual-Report.pdf"
# Read tables from the PDF
tables = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_path, pages='17')

# Iterate through extracted tables
df = pd.DataFrame(tables[0])
```

Once the data is in Python, we probably will need to modify it as the PDF table may not have been read correctly.
