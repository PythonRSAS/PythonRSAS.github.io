Within less than 2 years, two wars took places and are still ongoing, each has the potential to escalate and threaten our peaceful lives.  In addition, electricity cost per unit has more than doubled, and so is food.  How can we save more, how can we make our life styles lower emission and more sustainable?  (Higher emission also means higher cost, all else being equal).  We can begin by using technology already available to make our homes more energy efficient. 

# Passive Solar Heating for Cold Winters

A house should be south facing with south facing windows for optimal passive solar energy gain.  According to [this article](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/articles/dealing-south-facing-windows-summer#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20south%2Dfacing%20windows,the%20summer%20%2D%20even%20more%20so.) from Departement of Energy, "south-facing windows are best for daylighting. They let in the light all day long, and don't have as many problems with glare and heat as east- and west-facing windows". 

For the crafty and thrifty, window quilts can be both fun and practical. See [this](https://blog.lehmans.com/making-old-time-window-quilts/)

Inspired by the survivalists in the History channel's Alone show, having stones (or concrete) in the rooms can absorbe and keep the heat longer.  So the old stone houses are actually really good for energy conservation. 

# Solar Photovoltic 

A typical solar cell works like this:
a small amount of [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus) (磷), atomic number 15 with symbol "P",  is added to the pure silicon top layer.  This results in an excess of electrons or negative charge. 
Boron (硼), atomic number 5 with symbol "B", is added to the bottom silicon layer, which results in a deficiency of electrons. 
These two oppositely charged layers are separated by a barrier, the P-N junction.  When the sunlight penetrates the silicon layers, it imparts enough energy to the excess electrons to go through the barrier. 

Aluminum strips at the top and a continuous aluminum sheet at the bottom are used to distribute and collect the free electrons. 

If we complete the circuit, for example using wires and light bulb to connect to the aluminum conductors, the electrons will flow through the circuit as a current.
