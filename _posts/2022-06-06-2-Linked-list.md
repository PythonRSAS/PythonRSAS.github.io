description: linked list as an abstract data structure, what, why, and how

---

Linked lists were developed in 1955â€“1956, by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation as the primary data structure for their Information Processing Language. IPL was used by the authors to develop several early artificial intelligence programs.


A linked list is a kind of abstract data structure,  like a chain of objects, called *nodes*, each points to the next except the last one, which points to <span class="coding">\__None__</span> (NULL). 

Of course, it is made for doing something better than other data structures :)

# Compare with (abstract) array
* **Advantages**:
* *Fast insertion/deletion*: Unlike arrays (abstract data structure), linked lists are resizable at run-time as linked list nodes are stored at *arbitrary locations in memory*.  Fast Insertion and deletion operations because do not need to change the indices of other elements or storage location. 
  
* **Disadvantages**:
* *Slower search*: We cannot access elements in constant time as we do in arrays.  To find a node at position n, we have to start the search at the first (head) node and iterate through via <span class="coding">next</span>. 
* Linked lists takes more space than the array. 

![what is a linked list](../images/posts/linked_list.jpg)

In table Below we compare the abstract data structure of array and linked list:

Compare | array | linked list
---------|----------|---------
 size | fixed at birth | can change from insertion/deletion
 storage | static in continuous block of memory allocated during compile time | dynamic, nodes are located at run time
 ordering/sorting | fast direct access via index  | sequential, transverse from the head node via link (next)
 search | binary and linear search | linear search

# Linked lists uses

They are useful when we need fast insertion and deletion, and when we do not know in advance the size of data, or do not need random access when searching for items.

# Compare with arrays
[I adapted from a bunch of gurus at SOF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/393556/when-to-use-a-linked-list-over-an-array-array-list)
Linked lists are preferable over arrays when:

you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)

you don't know how many items will be in the list. With arrays, you may need to re-declare and copy memory if the array grows too big

you don't need random access to any elements

you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue)

Arrays are preferable when:

you need indexed/random access to elements

you know the number of elements in the array ahead of time so that you can allocate the correct amount of memory for the array

you need speed when iterating through all the elements in sequence. You can use pointer math on the array to access each element, whereas you need to lookup the node based on the pointer for each element in linked list, which may result in page faults which may result in performance hits.

memory is a concern. Filled arrays take up less memory than linked lists. Each element in the array is just the data. Each linked list node requires the data as well as one (or more) pointers to the other elements in the linked list.

Array Lists (like those in .Net) give you the benefits of arrays, but dynamically allocate resources for you so that you don't need to worry too much about list size and you can delete items at any index without any effort or re-shuffling elements around. Performance-wise, arraylists are slower than raw arrays.


# Linked list implementation
Python does not have a native support for linked list. So we need to build the node class first and then implement linked list. 

Each node is an *independent object that can contain anything*. 
        
<!-- * Indexing -->  
<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>node.py</div>

```py
class Node(object):
    # Each node has its data and a pointer that points to next node in the Linked List
    def __init__(self, data, next = None):
        self.data = data;
        self.next = next;

    # function to set data
    def setData(self, data):
        self.data = data;
        
    # function to get data of a particular node
    def getData(self):
        return self.datalin
    
    # function to set next node
    def setNext(self, next):
        self.next = next
        
    # function to get the next node
    def getNext(self):
        return self.next
```

In this implementation, linked list has the following common operations:
* Insert, insert at end, insert at beginning, insert between
* Delete (iterative find and then delete)               
* Search (iterative search)  
* Count number of elements
* Print list   

The <span class="coding">count</span> attribute is convenient because we don't need to go through the entire linked list to get the number of elements.  With each insert, the count increments by 1 whereas delete decreases by 1 with <span class="coding">delete</span>. 

However, this attribute potentially has a problem: if <span class="coding">LinkedList</span> is instantiated without a head, and a head is added later such as in <span class="coding">LL.head = Node("Hello")</span>, its count stays 0.  Therefore, we define count as the number of elements without head.

```py
    
class LinkedList(object):
    # Defining the head of the linked list
    def __init__(self, head = None):
        # if head = None:
        #     self.head = None
        #     self.count = 0
        # else: 
        #     self.head = head
        #     self.count = 1
        self.head = head
        self.count = 0
    # printing the data in the linked list
    def printLinkedList(self):
        temp = self.head
        while(temp):

            temp = temp.next

* In general, __array__ is considered a data structure for which size is fixed at the compile time and array memory is allocated either from __Data section__ (e.g. global array) or __Stack section__ (e.g. local array). 
* Similarly, linked list is considered a data structure for which size is not fixed and memory is allocated from __Heap section__ (e.g. using malloc() etc.) as and when needed. In this sense, array is taken as a static data structure (residing in Data or Stack section) while linked list is taken as a dynamic data structure (residing in Heap section).
* The array elements are allocated memory in sequence i.e. __contiguous memory__ while nodes of a linked list are non-contiguous in memory. Though it sounds trivial yet this is the most important difference between array and linked list. It should be noted that due to this contiguous versus non-contiguous memory, array and linked list are different.
