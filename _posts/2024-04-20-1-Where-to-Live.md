# Income tax

## NY
If you W2-work is in NY, then NY will tax you on your W2.  Your residence state will tax you on all other income if all other income are not from NY. 
NY and NJ do not have reciprocity. If you work in NY and live in NJ, you will need to pay NY income taxes as a non-resident and pay NJ income taxes as a resident. However, NJ residents can take a tax credit for taxes that have been paid to other jurisdictions.  See [nj.gov](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/njit14.shtml) for more details. 

If you value your wealth building, then don't live in NYC because NYC charges 3.876% of the NY income over $50,000, plus $1,813.

## NJ & PA

**reciprocal agreement**
New Jersey and Pennsylvania have a reciprocal agreement. Compensation paid to New Jersey residents employed in Pennsylvania is not subject to Pennsylvania wage income tax. 

The New Jersey/Pennsylvania Reciprocal Agreement does not apply to income or wage tax imposed and collected by the City of Philadelphia or any other municipality in Pennsylvania. That means a New Jersey resident who works in Philadelphia and pays city wage taxes can claim a credit for the taxes paid to Philadelphia.

**income tax rate comparison**
> PA rate is *NOT necessarily lower* than NJ.  
> 
Assume you live in Bethlehem, PA with EIT rate 1%.   For 2023 tax, PA flat 3.07% + EIT (local tax).  This comes to approximately 4.07%.  

If your location is Philly, then add another 2.5% (Phylly tax rate is 3.4985%).  That results to 6.57%.

Whereas NJ income tax is progressive based on a marginal table.  And NJ does not have local tax no matter which county you live in.  If your income is below $180k, living in NJ or Bethlehem, PA will yield similar total income tax.   It does not give you a tax advantage. 

But if your income is way above it, it will make a difference, especially for above $300k.  If you make $1 million a year, then it is better living in Florida or one of the states that do not have income tax, because it is about a $70k difference to NJ tax. 

[Income tax calculator at Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/income-tax-calculator/) is a starting place.  But be aware that this calculator does not take into account the very real local taxes. 

# Car insurance 
Unfortunately, car insurance is a legal requirment.  If you don't need a car, then by all means please do not have a car.  Hiring a ride is much cheapter than the overheads such as insurance.  

In general, your car must be registered and insured in the same state, since both vehicle registration and auto insurance are based on **permanent residence**. In fact, using an address for insurance that's different from the primary residence where you keep vehicle is a form of insurance fraud.

## NJ
New Jersey car insurance is more expensive. 
Car insurance in New Jersey is expensive because 3 reasons:
- it's a *no-fault* (aka "PIP") state and medical expenses are very high in NJ
- the highest population density of any state in the country
- In New Jersey, you can expect to pay approximately $6,080 per year for full coverage car insurance or $2,303 per year for minimum coverage. 

Car insurance model attributes: marital status, highes education level, career, homeowner, deductible, coverage

# Property tax (the "general tax rate")

General Tax Rates by County and Municipality
The General Tax Rate is a multiplier for use in determining the amount of tax levied upon each property. It is expressed as $1 per $100 of taxable assessed value. This rate is used to compute the tax bill.

Example General Tax Rate: Assessed Value 150,000 x General Tax Rate .03758 = Tax Bill 5,637

# Estate and inheritance tax
1. There are federal and state estate taxes on the properties to be inherited.  This reduces to the values of the estate to be passed down.  This is only relevant to HNI (high networth individuals).  
2. In addition, there are inheritance taxes on the people who are inheriting the estate (from 1 above).  


## Federal estate tax (death tax)

The federal government collects estate tax. Estate tax is a tax imposed on property and assets that are transferred through a will. However, the tax comes out of the estate, not the individuals receiving the property. You file estate taxes with the IRS, and once all decedent’s liabilities are paid off, the remaining property and assets will be distributed to the beneficiaries named in the will.

The estate tax ranges from rates of 18% to 40% and generally only applies to assets over $13.61 million in 2024. 

Thirteen states levy an estate tax. New York is one of them.  Exempt limit ranges from $4mm upward. 


## Inheritance tax
If you’re worried you may owe inheritance tax after receiving property or assets from a recently passed loved one, don’t worry—only six states in the United States impose an inheritance tax. These states include Pennsylvania, Nebraska, New Jersey, Kentucky, Maryland, and Iowa. If you do happen to live in one of these six states, however, there are a few things you should know about their inheritance tax laws, because you might be exempt from paying them. 

### PA
Pennsylvania’s inheritance tax rates depend on the relationship you have with the decedent, and a few other factors, that go as follows:

If you are the spouse or a child under 21-years-old to a deceased parent, you will not have to pay inheritance tax on property or assets you received. Additionally, charities, governmental agencies, and additional exempt institutions do not have to pay inheritance tax.

If you are a direct descendant, such as a grandchild, or a lineal heir, such as a grandparent or parent, you will face a **5%** inheritance tax on all transfers made to you.
If you are a sibling receiving an inheritance, you will face a 12% inheritance tax on transfers made to you.
All other heirs will pay 15%.

> Exemptions: certain agricultural property: agrarian commodities, forest reserves, agricultural reserves, or ***agricultural use property***. 

### NJ
New Jersey
New Jersey’s inheritance tax rates depend on the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiaries, and are categorized into four classes: Class A, C, D, and E.

Class A beneficiaries include parents, grandparents, spouses, children, mutually acknowledged children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren (etc.), domestic partners, and civil union partners of the decedent. If you are a Class A beneficiary, you ***do not have to pay inheritance tax*** on any transfer made to you.
