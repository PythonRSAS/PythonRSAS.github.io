For decades, the LIBOR (London interbank offered rate), the cost of large global banks can borrow from each other on wholesale markets, was the de facto benchmark for floating-rate borrowing (LIBOR + spread) around the world.  It’s calculated from a daily survey of more than 15 large banks that estimate the price to borrow from each other without collateral.

SOFR measures the cost of overnight borrowings through repo transactions collateralized with U.S. Treasury securities, which is the deepest and most liquid money market in the U.S.

Almost one year year, Mr.Michael  Held, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of The New York Fed in [SOFR and the Transition from LIBOR](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2019/hel190226){:target="_blank"} made a good summary of the context, rational, challenges and motivations on the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. 

### Impact $

> Although actual transactions underlying LIBOR have diminished, its use as a benchmark has become ubiquitous.  The gross notional value of all financial products tied to U.S. dollar LIBOR is around $200 trillion—about 10 times U.S. GDP.5  That includes $3.4 trillion of business loans, $1.8 trillion of floating-rate notes and bonds, another $1.8 trillion of securitizations, and $1.3 trillion of consumer loans held by about four million individual retail consumers, including around $1.2 trillion of residential mortgage loans.  The remaining 95% of exposures are derivative contracts, which we learned in the financial crisis have consequences for both Wall Street and Main Street.  

Below chart reflects the numbers in Mr. Held's Feb 2019 speech:

95% of the LIBOR-based contracts are derivatives, which were directly linked to the 2009 Financial crisis.

Chart below reflects the sizes of non-derivative contracts out of the $200 Trillion.

### Comparions of SOFR and LIBOR

| SOFR                |    LIBOR          |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|
| secured	 | unsecured    |
| "backward-looking"| forward-looking    |
| calculated & published by New York Fed daily | calculated & published daily by ICE benchmark    |
| based on actual transactions | based on LIBOR bank submissions & expert judgement"    |
| based on $1T daily transaction (repo markets)| based on about sum total of $1 B daily transaction in 3 month  |
|volatile, especially near quarter- and year-end| stable|

As can be seen from the time series below, SOFR is much more volatile.
