# Array as an abstract data type
As an abstract data type, an array is a list of similar data (sounds like circular definition). An array of an array is a 2-dimensional array, i.e. matrix. 
- name
- type: the type of data is stored, and all have to be the *same* within one array
- size: it is fixed once it is defined, and **cannot be changed** once created

1. Access: random access use *index* as all elements are indexed, run time is $$O(1)$$; 
2. Search:  $$O(n)$$, may need to go over each element to find an item from an unsorted array
3. Insert:  $$O(n)$$, because we need to shift the elements, which are after the index where we want to insert the item, to the *'right'* for one space  
4. Delete:  $$O(n)$$, because we need to shift the elements, which are after the index where we want to insert the item, to the *"left"* for one space  

pros | cons
---------|----------
good for storing similar data | data must be the same; size cannot be changed once created 
efficient accessing | insert/delete are not as efficent 

Array elements are stored in contiguous (continuous) memory locations. Its efficiency is in scaling its attributes to all its elements. 

## ArrayList

ArrayList is a derivation of array.  It is a *growing* array, where the size can be changed.  It has more functionality than an array, including the following 6 common methods:
- add
- remove
- get
- set
- clear
- toArray

**In Python, arrays and arrayLists are grouped together into a single data structured called "Lists"**. 


# Array in python
Numpy array is an multidimensional implementation of array.  It is efficient both in time and space complexity. 

But Python does not have a native support for arrays.  It has a more generic data structure called *list*.  Unlike arrays in some other languages, list length can be changed dynamically, and can hold different data types. 

Because of these flexbilities, lists have a higher costs: for each element, we need eight bytes for the reference.   

```python
In [1]: A = ['me', 'you', 1, 2, (1,2)]

In [2]: A[-1]
Out[2]: (1, 2)

In [3]: list(A[0])
Out[3]: ['m', 'e']

In [4]: A = [1]

In [5]: A*5
Out[5]: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
> Note that the *tuple* type is very similar to the *list* type, except that tuple type is immutable.  However, if a list is an element of a tuple, it is still mutable. 


Action | syntax
---------|----------
 instantiating 1D array| <span class="coding"> [0,1,2,3,4]</span>,  <span class="coding">list(range(5))</span>
 instantiating 2D array| <span class="coding"> [[0,1,2,3,4],[1,2], [0]]</span>, also called "nested list"
 access |  <span class="coding">[0]</span> gives the first element,  <span class="coding">[~0] </span> reverse access| 
 append |  <span class="coding">.append() </span>
 insert |   <span class="coding">.insert(2,100)</span>
 reverse |  <span class="coding">.reverse()</span> in-place, or <span class="coding">reversed(list)</span> returns an iterator

## Slicing
It is important to know how to slice and dice an array using <span class="coding">:</span> the slicing operator and other directional operators <span class="coding">-</span> and, to a less extent, <span class="coding">~</span> (reverse direction). 
* <span class="coding">[x:y:z]</span> means begin at x, end at y-1, with step size z.  For example <span class="coding">[5:1:-2]</span> means begin at index 5, end at index 1, with step size -2, i.e. the indices sliced are: 5, 3
* <span class="coding">[-1] </span> is the last element of list 

## List comprehension

One special way to create lists is *list comprehension*.   

```python
In [6]: print([x**2 for x in range(6) if x%2 == 0])
Out[6]: [0 4 16]
```
* **Loop through rows of numpy array** 
List comprehension can be used on numpy arrays as well as shown in example below.  An numpy array is treated as a list of lists. <span class="coding">[i.mean() for i in A]</span> iterates through elements (rows) of array A, and outputs the mean for each.  
```python
In [7]: import numpy as np
    ...: A = np.random.randint(10, size = (4,4))
    ...: print(A)
[[2 1 6 9]
 [3 9 6 8]
 [4 0 7 2]
 [8 6 4 6]]
In [8]: [i.mean() for i in A]
Out[8]: [4.5, 6.5, 3.25, 6.0]
```

* **Filtering** 
List comprehension can be used to filter a list of strings. 

```python
In [9]: countries = ['USA', 'Uruguay','Uzbekistan','Venezuela','Vietnam','UFO']
    ...: [i for i in countries if i.lower().startswith('u') and i.lower().endswith('a') and len(i) > 2]
Out[9]: ['USA']
```

* **Access elements of elements** 
List comprehension can be used to flatten a list of lists.  [i for i in A] produces the same A.  After the expression <span class="coding">i</span> is substituted by <span class="coding">j</span>, which iterates through <span class="coding">i</span>, we get the elements of the elements in one list. 
```python
In [10]: A = [[1,2,3],[(3.14, 2.718281828459045)],['sky','earth']]
    ...: [i for i in A]
Out[10]: [[1, 2, 3], [(3.14, 2.718281828459045)], ['sky', 'earth']]
In [11]: [j for i in A for j in i]
Out[11]: [1, 2, 3, (3.14, 2.718281828459045), 'sky', 'earth']
```

* **Test palindromic and other operations** 
List comprehension is used in the following example to check if a string is palindromic. 

```python
In [12]: s = 'abcdcba'

In [13]: all(s[i] == s[~i] for i in range(len(s) // 2))
Out[13]: True
```

* **When NOT to use list comprehension**
List comprehension is very useful for small lists. But, do not use list comprehension when:
* the desired output is not a list
* the list is long, which costs too much in memory and run time
* although list comprehensions can handle multiple layers of loops, more than 2 layers becomes difficult to understand

## Tips on working with arrays from computer science perspective

* Inserting element to the front of array is slow.  It is faster to write to the back (append)
* Deleting an element will require moving all subsequent elements.  It is better to overwrite it so as not to disturb other elements
* Sort at the end when returning if possible
* Try to reduce space complexity to $$O(1)$$ (in-place)

# The Dutch flag partitioning problem
We want to partition an array in the following fashion:
Given an element called "pivot" (or the index of it) of the array of integers,  the ones smaller than this number should be placed before this number, and the ones before than this number after. 

The following solution has time complexity $$O(n)$$ and space complexity $$O(1)$$.  I did this problem a few times.  There are 4 places I found myself making mistakes:
1. indent of the return (or forgot to return)
2. compare with the pivot, not anything else
3. the direction of the range
4. forgot to increment/decrement the pointer indices

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>flag_partition.py</div>

```py
def flag_partition(pivot_idx, A):
    pivot = A[pivot_idx]
    N = len(A)
    small_idx = 0
    big_idx = N - 1
    print("Pivot is ",A[pivot_idx])
    # move smaller ones to the front
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] < pivot:
            A[i], A[small_idx] = A[small_idx], A[i]
            small_idx += 1

    # move bigger ones to the front
    for i in reversed(range(N)):
        if A[i] < pivot:
            break
        if A[i] > pivot:
            A[i], A[big_idx] = A[big_idx], A[i]
            big_idx -= 1

    return A
lt = [0, 1,2,0,2,1,1]
print(flag_partition(3,lt))
```

The following code are from Github repository "Data Structure using Python". 

<div class="code-head"><span>code</span>Array.py</div>

```py
class Array(object):
    ''' sizeOfArray: denotes the total size of the array to be initialized
       arrayType: denotes the data type of the array(as all the elements of the array have same data type)
       arrayItems: values at each position of array
    '''
    def __init__(self, sizeOfArray, arrayType = int):
        self.sizeOfArray = len(list(map(arrayType, range(sizeOfArray))))
        self.arrayItems =[arrayType(0)] * sizeOfArray    # initialize array with zeroes
        self.arrayType = arrayType

    def __str__(self):
        return ' '.join([str(i) for i in self.arrayItems])

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.arrayItems)

    # magic methods to enable indexing
    def __setitem__(self, index, data):
        self.arrayItems[index] = data

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.arrayItems[index]

    # function for search
    def search(self, keyToSearch):
        for i in range(self.sizeOfArray):
            if (self.arrayItems[i] == keyToSearch):      # brute-forcing
                return i                                 # index at which element/ key was found

        return -1                                        # if key not found, return -1

    # function for inserting an element
    def insert(self, keyToInsert, position):
        if(self.sizeOfArray > position):
            for i in range(self.sizeOfArray - 2, position - 1, -1):
                self.arrayItems[i + 1] = self.arrayItems[i]
            self.arrayItems[position] = keyToInsert
        else:
            print('Array size is:', self.sizeOfArray)

    # function to delete an element
    def delete(self, keyToDelete, position):
        if(self.sizeOfArray > position):
            for i in range(position, self.sizeOfArray - 1):
                self.arrayItems[i] = self.arrayItems[i + 1]
            self.arrayItems[i + 1] = self.arrayType(0)
        else:
            print('Array size is:', self.sizeOfArray)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = Array(10, int)
    a.insert(2, 2)
    a.insert(3, 1)
    a.insert(4,7)
    print(len(a))

```
We can use the array class we defined.  For example,

```python
# access
a = Array(100,int)
idx = a.search(0)
print("found at", idx)

a.insert(2,2)
print(a)

```
