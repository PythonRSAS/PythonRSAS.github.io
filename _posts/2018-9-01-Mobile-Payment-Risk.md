Faster mobile payments through messaging, social media apps, payment apps, QR code, and even face scan give users a lot of convinience but also opens more room for fraud risk, which has been on the rise.   

There is a Chinese saying "道高一尺,魔高一丈".  The English translation is "While the priest climbs a post, the devil climbs ten." 

Each authentication method has its shortfalls.  Frausters can steal and fake finger prints or other types of unique IDs just like how they steal and fake passwords or checks.    A quick search will yield many sites that offer them for sale. 

While it is not possible to eliminate payment fraud, the risk can be minimized and contained.

> **Risk tolerance**

Einstein once said “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler".   

More layers of authentication 身份验证 can affect user experience and cause frustrations from lock-outs.  So, have strong authentication, but not stronger. 

More private information collected about users will increase risk for data leak.  So, collect as much as needed, but not more. 

More false alerts increases costs of doing business.  So, set rules, thresholds and KPIs that raise enough alerts, but not more. 

It is important to establish the level of risk tolerance through understanding how much loss is tolerable for how much profit at particular amount of business. 

> **Partner with internal and external teams**

Fraud risk managers know that they need to balance fraud losses with customer experience and operational overhead. 

Other internal teams, such as product and marketing teams often are too excited in new product launches to see the fraud risks.  

It is important to have a good working partnership with Engineering, Product, Operations and Compliance teams to conceive, design, and monitor fraud strategies and recommend product features in order to mitigate fraud risk in the most precise manner (simple but not simpler), collaborate on technology that will fit with the organization’s overall IT architecture and strategy, and to secure the funding and IT resources to implement fraud controls.

Externally, fraud risk team need to work with business partners and regulators. 

> **Fraud risk team**

Fraud management is as much as technology issue as any other.  

The fraud risk team should have data engineer/scientists as well as people who are knowledgeable in investigations and have the sensitivity for identify and explore emerging risks. 

> **Policies and procedures**

The end-to-end fraud prevention process include:

* Customer authentication 
* Wallet provisioning 
* Real-time fraud protection 
* Transaction monitoring 
* Identification and verification 
* Reporting and management information 
* Fraud case review 
* Root cause analysis 
* Investigations and recovery 
* Machine learning feedback loop

> **Implementing the analytic fraud risk function**

Best customer service. Lowest fraud rates than competitors. Optimal operational overhead. Balancing those three priorities requires analytics-driven tools and technologies

The fraud technology should span account opening, transaction monitoring and network analysis, with broad data sharing and supported by analytics-driven rules and models.

Real-time transaction monitoring is essential for both traditional and new payment types. Ideally, a system will monitor all transactions, both monetary and non-monetary. 

It is more important to have a single and versatile fraud solution for all contact channels – internet, telephone, mobile, digital and in-person – to gain a holistic customer view. 

Anti-fraud mechanisms should provide a consistent and unified view across checks, debit cards, credit cards, ACH, wire transfers, deposits, merchant transactions and digital/online payments. 

The 360-degree customer view created by an anti-fraud system can also add value for anti-money laundering (AML), credit risk management, marketing and sales efforts. Activities that look innocuous by themselves can appear suspicious when seen in broader context. 

Openness and flexibility of the technology architecture and an API approach to risk analytics and reporting.

* Transaction monitoring with rules and optimized models in real time, allowing single customer view.
* Geolocation capability and device ID analysis for mobile and digital banking.
* Network and link analytics for detecting collusion and trade finance fraud and for supporting AML analysis and investigations. 
* Integrated alert management, accessible across the enterprise to support triaged alerts and investigations for all financial crimes. 
* One-time passwords or biometrics for strong customer authentication. 
* Data visualization dashboards for identifying potentially suspicious events and connections. 

Best customer service, lowest fraud rates than competitors, and optimal operational overhead.  Balancing the three is the goal of  fraud risk management.
