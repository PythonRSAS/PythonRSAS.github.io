I remember reading Rockerfeller biography.  Somewhere it said that Standard Oil paid better than most in the industry and took better care of employees. 

Whereas, some modern big public companies that claim to be most ESG are the worst at it.  Let's look at a global large bank as an example. 

The CEO received pay raises while 20000 employees face layoffs.  When CEOs receive substantial raises while employees are laid off or facing financial hardships, it highlights the significant income inequality within the organization. This can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment among employees.

1. **Criticism and Resentment**: Many people view this situation as highly unfair and unjust. They see it as a reflection of corporate greed, where top executives prioritize their own financial gain over the well-being of their employees. This can lead to feelings of resentment towards the CEO and the company as a whole.

2. **Distrust and Lack of Confidence**: Employees may lose trust in the leadership of the company when they perceive such actions. They might question the decision-making processes within the organization and doubt the CEO's ability to lead effectively.

3. **Public Relations and Image Damage**: Companies that are perceived as prioritizing executive compensation over employee well-being may suffer from negative publicity and damage to their reputation. This can have long-term consequences, including difficulty attracting and retaining talent, as well as losing customer trust and loyalty.

4. **Shareholder Concerns**: Some shareholders may also be critical of excessive executive compensation, especially if they believe it's not aligned with company performance or shareholder interests. They may advocate for greater transparency and accountability regarding executive pay decisions.

5. **Defense and Justification**: On the other hand, supporters of CEOs receiving pay raises during layoffs might argue that executive compensation is often tied to performance metrics and market benchmarks. They may argue that CEOs are responsible for making difficult decisions to ensure the long-term viability and profitability of the company, which sometimes includes restructuring and cost-cutting measures.

Overall, the perception of CEOs receiving pay raises during layoffs is typically negative, as it highlights issues of income inequality, corporate governance, and fairness within organizations. However, there can be differing opinions based on individual perspectives, corporate cultures, and broader economic contexts.
